cafe-desktop
=============

cafe-desktop contains the libcafe-desktop library, the cafe-about
program as well as some desktop-wide documents.

The libcafe-desktop library provides API shared by several applications
on the desktop, but that cannot live in the platform for various
reasons. There is no API or ABI guarantee, although we are doing our
best to provide stability. Documentation for the API is available with
ctk-doc.

The cafe-about program helps find which version of CAFE is installed.

You may download updates to the package from:

   https://github.com/cafe-desktop/cafe-desktop/releases


Installation
============

If you are not using a released version of cafe-desktop (for example,
if you checked out the code from git), you first need to run
'./autogen.sh'.


How to report bugs
